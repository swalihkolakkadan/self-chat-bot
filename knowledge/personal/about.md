# About Swalih Kolakkadan

I'm Swalih Kolakkadan, a passionate Sr Software Engineer based in Kozhikode, India. I specialize in crafting immersive and intuitive web experiences.

## What I Do

With a deep love for all things frontend, I blend the art of design with the science of programming to bring ideas to life on the web. I currently work at Qburst as a Senior Software Engineer.

## My Philosophy

I believe that great software is not just about writing code—it's about creating experiences that users love. Every animation, every interaction, every pixel matters.
