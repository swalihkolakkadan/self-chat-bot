# About Swalih Kolakkadan

I'm Swalih Kolakkadan, a passionate Sr Software Engineer based in Kozhikode, India. I specialize in crafting immersive and intuitive web experiences.

## What I Do

With a deep love for all things frontend, I blend the art of design with the science of programming to bring ideas to life on the web. I currently work at Qburst as a Senior Software Engineer.

## My Philosophy

I believe that great software is not just about writing code—it's about creating experiences that users love. Every animation, every interaction, every pixel matters.

## My Journey

My love for computers started young—way before I wrote my first line of code. I was the kid cracking games and tinkering with every setting I could find.
The real turning point came during my higher studies when I met **Professor Riyas**. He introduced me to the world of programming, and I was hooked.
I studied at **MES College of Engineering**, where I was a self-proclaimed "middle bencher." I wasn't the one chasing 4.0 GPAs; I was the one building products, launching web apps, and learning by _doing_.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm away from the keyboard, you'll probably find me:

- **On the Road**: taking my **i20** for long road trips (I love travelling!).
- **Gaming**: battling it out in **FIFA** with my brother.
- **Sports**: playing Badminton or Football.
